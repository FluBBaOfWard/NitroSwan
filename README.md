# NitroSwan V0.1.2

<img align="right" width="220" src="./logo.png" />

This is a Bandai WonderSwan (Color/Crystal) & PocketChallenge V2 emulator for the Nintendo DS.

## How to use:

Depending on your flashcart you might have to DLDI patch the emulator.
Create a folder named "nitroswan" in either the root of your flash card or in the
data folder. Now put game/bios files into a folder where you have roms.
The save files should be compatible with most other WonderSwan emulators.

When the emulator starts, you can either press L+R or tap on the screen to open
up the menu.
Now you can use the cross or touchscreen to navigate the menus, A or double tap
to select an option, B or the top of the screen to go back a step.

To select between the tabs use R & L or the touchscreen.

Hold Start while starting a game to enter the boot rom settings.
